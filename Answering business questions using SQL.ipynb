    "\n",
    "* purchase a whole album\n",
    "* purchase a collection of one or more individual tracks.\n",
    "The store does not let customers purchase a whole album, and then add individual tracks to that same purchase (unless they do that by choosing each track manually). When customers purchase albums they are charged the same price as if they had purchased each of those tracks separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Management are currently considering changing their purchasing strategy to save money. The strategy they are considering is to purchase only the most popular tracks from each album from record companies, instead of purchasing every track from an album.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been asked to find out what percentage of purchases are individual tracks vs whole albums, so that management can use this data to understand the effect this decision might have on overall revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very common when we are performing an analysis to have 'edge cases' which prevent we from getting a 100% accurate answer to our question. In this instance, we have two edge cases to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Albums that have only one or two tracks are likely to be purchased by customers as part of a collection of individual tracks.\n",
    "* Customers may decide to manually select every track from an album, and then add a few individual tracks from other albums to their purchase.\n",
    "In the first case, since our analysis is concerned with maximizing revenue we can safely ignore albums consisting of only a few tracks. The company has previously done analysis to confirm that the second case does not happen often, so we can ignore this case also.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer the question, we're going to have to identify whether each invoice has all the tracks from an album. We can do this by getting the list of tracks from an invoice and comparing it to the list of tracks from an album. We can find the album to compare the purchase to by looking up the album that one of the purchased tracks belongs to. It doesn't matter which track we pick, since if it's an album purchase, that album will be the same for all tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare two tables of value, we can use the EXCEPT operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we had three tables in a database, as shown in the diagram below:\n",
    "![diagramme1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/191/test_tables.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find a way to compare the letters columns from test_table_2, and test_table_3 to test_table_1 to see if they they are identical to test_table_1. Let's use EXCEPT with the two identical tables and see what we get with the first two tables:\n",
    "![diagramme2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/191/compare_example_1.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's compare what we get with test_table_1 and test_table_3:\n",
    "![diagramme3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/191/compare_example_2.svg)\n",
    "If we run this directly in SQLite, we will get no result at all. This is useful to us - we can check whether the exception of two subqueries IS NULL. If we reverse the order of the tables around the EXCEPT operator we get the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try reversing the order of the EXCEPT operator for the first two tables:\n",
    "![diagramme4](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/191/compare_example_3.svg)\n",
    "Here, we get a null value even though the two tables are not identical. That's because all of the values for letter in test_table_2 are also in test_table_1, even if test_table_1 has an extra value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this we need to combine both variations with AND clause:\n",
    "![diagramme5](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/191/compare_example_4.svg)\n",
    "Once we've made the comparison, we can  wrap it in a CASE statement to add a column that tells us if that invoice was an album purchase or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have everything we need to collate data on album vs single track purchases. This is easily the hardest query we have written so far, so take our time, and remember the query writing tips from the first screen!\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a query that categorizes each invoice as either an album purchase or not, and calculates the following summary statistics:\n",
    "* Number of invoices\n",
    "* Percentage of invoices\n",
    "2. Write one to two sentences explaining our findings, and making a prospective recommendation on whether the Chinook store should continue to buy full albums from record companies"
